The first of many, "great things to look forward to!"

Starting classes on 5/4/21 @ SNHU for BSCS with concentration in software engineering.

While working on my core classes, I will be working & learning even harder on "Python DEV. and other full stack languages." So that I will be ahead of the curve, when my actual Computer Science classes start.

After which I plan to continue on and complete a Masters ... and eventually a doctorates for my PHD in computer science. Thank You Michael D. Breaux
